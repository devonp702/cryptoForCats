      <h2>What is Crypto?</h2>
      <p>Cryptocurrency is an online store of money shared across a network of computers using blockchain to track transactions. The blockchain is basicly a big public ledger where all of the transactions on the network are stored. What this means in simple terms is that cryptocurrency is money in digital form, that can be used to buy, trade, and transfer across the web. The biggest and first of these was Bitcoin, but many alt coins and tokens have begun to spring up recently, and are worth looking into. 
        Many coins and tokens have other secondary uses, like recording data, running applications or storing files on their network, making them more than just money.</p>
        <p>
        It would be easy to ignore crypto, and overlook it as a new fad, or potential bubble ready to pop, but there are so many great new technologies coming out every day related to blockchain and DeFi or decentralized finance. These tools allow us to be our own bank, and can be quite advanced. To get started The most important things to know are to do your own research on any coin you may want to purchase (look up the “white paper” on their website!), and avoid panic reactions when working with crypto, for example selling because “It’s crashing down as we speak!” can lead to selling low, and further panic buying at high prices, trying to catch up later.
      </p><p>
        One of the best strategies for beginners is called DCA, Dollar Cost Averaging, and boils down to buying a set amount of a crypto (ex, $5, $20 or $100), or whatever amount you feel comfortable with possibly losing, each payday, or monthly, or weekly. Whatever you do, do it consistently and stick to the plan. The idea is to keep your average buying price low, and to increase your investment in a slow and steady way.</p>
        <h3>Some of my favorite investments to start with...</h3>

      <h2>Where can I buy it?</h2>
      <p>When buying crypto you don't need to buy a whole "coin" at a time. For example, its possible to start with just $5 of BTC (Bitcoin). Actually, most new investors into bitcoin have less than 0.01 BTC saved up because of its steep price per coin. Every little bit helps, five dollars a month ago can easily turn into fifty with time, inflation, and patience. The following websites can help you get started on your investment into cryptocurrency. </p>
